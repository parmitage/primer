Primer
------
Primer is a functional programming language you can learn in an afternoon. This project is a working reference implementation of Primer in that it defines the syntax and semantics of the language. A second implementation is now underway to provide a more complete interpreter.

To get a feel for Primer, please have a look at the examples directory.
