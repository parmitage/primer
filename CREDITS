Phil Armitage designed Primer with the help of the following people.

Michael Ben-Yosef has provided invaluable input into the design of
both the language and the tutorial. His ability to debug Primer code
without a working copy of the interpreter was quite extraordinary!

Damon Dolby has tested several releases of the code and tolerated numerous
incompatible changes to the language syntax.
